                        <h3>Acquisition</h3>
                        <p>The 911 Turbo can be obtained during the Chippin' In quest, right after the fight against Jeremiah Grayson. You can either spare him so he gives you the keys to the car, or take them from his body if you decide to kill him. Afterwards, go to the ladder on the starboard of the ship and activate the button you'll find up there. One of the containers will be lifted down. Just go there, open the container doors and take the car.</p>
                        <h3>Development</h3>
                        <p>An unpublished story by Mike Pondsmith called "The Punk and the Parking Space" serves as a backstory to the car and its first appearance in the Never Fade Away adventure.</p>
                        <h3>Design</h3>
                        <p>The developers worked alongside with Porsche to recreate the car in Cyberpunk 2077 with adjustments for the game world.</p>
